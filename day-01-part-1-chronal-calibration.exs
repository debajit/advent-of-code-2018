  PROBLEM:

  After feeling like you've been falling for a few minutes, you look at
  the device's tiny screen. "Error: Device must be calibrated before
  first use. Frequency drift detected. Cannot maintain destination
  lock." Below the message, the device shows a sequence of changes in
  frequency (your puzzle input). A value like +6 means the current
  frequency increases by 6; a value like -3 means the current frequency
  decreases by 3.

  For example, if the device displays frequency changes of +1, -2, +3,
  +1, then starting from a frequency of zero, the following changes
  would occur:

  Current frequency  0, change of +1; resulting frequency  1.
  Current frequency  1, change of -2; resulting frequency -1.
  Current frequency -1, change of +3; resulting frequency  2.
  Current frequency  2, change of +1; resulting frequency  3.
  In this example, the resulting frequency is 3.

  Here are other example situations:

  +1, +1, +1 results in  3
  +1, +1, -2 results in  0
  -1, -2, -3 results in -6

  Starting with a frequency of zero, what is the resulting frequency
  after all of the changes in frequency have been applied?

  SOLUTION:
  Run this file as follows:
  % elixir day-01-part-1-chronal-calibration.exs input_file.txt
  """

  def compute_frequency(input_file) do
    File.stream!(input_file)
    |> Stream.map(&String.trim/1)
    |> Stream.map(&String.to_integer/1)
    |> Enum.sum
  end
end

[input_file] = System.argv
IO.inspect ChronalCalibration.compute_frequency(input_file)
